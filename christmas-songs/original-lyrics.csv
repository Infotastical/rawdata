White Christmas,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
And may all your Christmases be white  all your Christmases be white  
And may all your Christmases be white  all your Christmases be white  
And may all your Christmases be
 All your Christmases be white  
 All your Christmases be white  "

Holy infant so tender and mild

Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me  so
You better watch out  you better not cry
Better not pout  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out  you better not cry
Better not pout  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants  boats  and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out  you better not cry
Better not pout  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man  He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
You better watch out  you better not cry
Better not pout  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out  you better not cry
Better not pout  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants  boats  and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out  you better not cry
Better not pout  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"
Winter Wonderland,"Sleigh bells ring  are you listening
In the lane  snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say  Are you married?
We'll say  No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on  we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down
When it snows  ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play  the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland"
Rudolph  the Red Nosed Reindeer,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph  with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history""
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it

Join in any reindeer games

Santa came to say
""Rudolph  with your nose so bright

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"""
O Holy Night,"O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine o night
O night divine
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine o night
O night divine
Ooh yes it was
Ooh it is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Oh yeah  oh yeah  oh yeah  yeah
It was a holy holy holy  oh oh oh"

Last Christmas,"Last Christmas  I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year  to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas  I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year  to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me  baby
Do you recognize me?
Well  it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
 Merry Christmas!   I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying  ""I love you  "" I meant it
Now  I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas  I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year  to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas  I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year  to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A crowded room  friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you  and your soul of ice
My god  I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now  I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
Last Christmas  I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year  to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas  I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year  to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special"

Frosty the Snowman,"Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal
Frosty the Snowman
Made the children laugh and play
And were they surprised when
Before their eyes
He came to life that day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have fun
Now before I melt away
So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow"

Baby It's Cold Outside,"I really can't stay  but baby  it's cold outside  
I've got to go away  but baby  it's cold outside  
This evening has been  been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  i'll hold your hands  they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry  beautiful what's your hurry?  
My father will be pacing the floor  listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry  beautiful please don't hurry  
But maybe just a half a drink more  put some records on while I pour  
The neighbors might think  baby  it's bad out there  
Say what's in this drink?  no cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how  your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  i'll take your hat  your hair looks swell  
I ought to say  no  no  no sir  mind if I move in closer?  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?  
I really can't stay  oh baby don't hold out  
But baby  it's cold outside
I simply must go  but baby  it's cold outside  
The answer is no  but baby  it's cold outside  
Your welcome has been how lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  look out the window at this dawn  
My sister will be suspicious  gosh your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  waves upon the tropical shore  
My maiden aunts mind is vicious  gosh your lips are delicious  
But maybe just a cigarette more  never such a blizzard before  
I've gotta get home but baby  you'd freeze out there  
Say lend me a coat it's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  i thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see?  how can you do this thing to me?  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  think of my lifelong sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  if you got pnuemonia and died  
I really can't stay  get over that old out  
Baby  it's cold
Baby  it's cold outside"
It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten  it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel  one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
Sure it's Christmas  once more"
Do They Know It's Christmas,"It's Christmastime  there's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime  we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime
But say a prayer  pray for the other ones
At Christmastime it's hard  but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing 
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Here's to you
Raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them
Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again"

Christmastime is Here,"Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh  that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Oh  that we could always see
Such spirit through the year"
The Christmas Song,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times  many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times  many ways
Merry Christmas to you"

All I want for Christmas
Is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas

With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby"

Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing  people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver bells   silver bells   silver bells  silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling   ring-a-ling  
Hear them ring   hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights  even stoplights
Blinkin' bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch  see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big day
And above all this bustle you hear
Silver bells  The corner Santa Claus  
Silver bells  Is busy now because  
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling  it fills the winter air

Let it Snow,"Oh  the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow  let it snow  let it snow
Man it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I brought me some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow  let it snow  let it snow
When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And  my dear  we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow  let it snow  and snow
When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Oh the fire is slowly dying
And  my dear  we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow  let it snow  let it snow"
Hallelujah,"Well I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music  do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth  the fifth  the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know  I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah"
Carol of the Bells,"Hark how the bells 
Sweet silver bells 
All seem to say 
Throw cares away
Christmas is here 
Bringing good cheer 
To young and old 
Meek and the bold.
Ding dong ding dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling.
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere
Filling the air.
Oh how they pound 
Raising the sound 
O'er hill and dale 
Telling their tale.
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer 
Christmas is here.
Merry  Merry  Merry  Merry Christmas 
Merry  Merry  Merry  Merry Christmas.
On on they send 
On without end 
Their joyful tone
To every home.
Ding dong ding dong

Hark how the bells 
Sweet silver bells 
All seem to say 
Throw cares away
 We will throw cares away  
Christmas is here 
Bringing good cheer 
To young and old 
Meek and the bold.
 Bringing cheer to the young and old  
Oh how they pound 
Raising the sound 
O'er hill and dale 
Telling their tale.
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer 
Christmas is here.

Fairytale of New York,"It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me  won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The Rare Old Mountain Dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true
They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging 
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag  you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day"

Angels We Have Heard on High,"Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly  sweetly through the night
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their brief delight
Gloria  in excelsis Deo
Gloria  in excelsis Deo
Shepherds  why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Gloria  in excelsis Deo
Gloria  in excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing 
Come  adore on bended knee 
Christ the Lord  the newborn King.
